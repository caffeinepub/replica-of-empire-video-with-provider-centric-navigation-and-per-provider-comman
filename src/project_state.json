  "summary": "Replica of the Empire Video+ app, extended with a provider-centric UI where each AI provider has its own dedicated page with its own chatbot/command box and provider-specific options/workflows tailored to that provider’s capabilities, and with real provider API integrations so workflows (e.g., image generation) actually execute once keys are uploaded (including multi-model support where applicable).",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Adopt a provider-module architecture (routing + UI + services per provider) so each provider page can be isolated while sharing common components.",
    "Persist chatbot context/history per provider (separate storage namespaces/keys per provider) to prevent cross-provider context mixing.",
    "Provider registry should be data-driven and support both fixed providers and user-configurable custom slots (name + key) as first-class entries.",
    "Each provider page should include a capability summary/list specific to that provider (even if initially static/placeholder).",
    "Make provider pages capability-driven: render provider-specific UI modules/workflows (e.g., app builder, video generator) based on provider capability metadata rather than a one-size-fits-all page.",
    "Maintain a per-provider library of recommended prompt templates tied to capabilities and surface them contextually on each provider page.",
    "Replace 'Not Integrated Yet' placeholders with capability-driven provider execution adapters/services so provider pages can perform real API calls once credentials are present (including multi-model selection support where applicable)."
